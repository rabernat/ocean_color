# Routines for working with ocean color

## NASA's OceanColor Web

The single source for ocean color data is the website
http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/

The available data products and their processing are described in the
[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Ocean Data Processing System
Operations, Project Data and Software Management
Plan](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/files/governance/odps_opdsm_plan_may2016.pdf).

Below we reproduce some of the important tables from that document.
